    "#Question.1 : What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "#Answer.1 : # Purpose of Grid Search CV in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Optimal Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "#    - Machine learning models often have hyperparameters that need to be set before training.\n",
    "#    - The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly impact the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Grid Search CV:**\n",
    "#    - Grid Search CV is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "#    - It systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations to find the optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **How Grid Search CV Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#    a. **Define Hyperparameter Grid:**\n",
    "#       - Specify a grid of hyperparameter values to be explored.\n",
    "#       - For example, in scikit-learn, this can be done using a dictionary with hyperparameter names as keys and \n",
    "#lists of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#         ```python\n",
    "#         param_grid = {'param_name': [value1, value2, ...]}\n",
    "#         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#    b. **Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "#       - Divide the dataset into multiple folds (subsets).\n",
    "#       - For each combination of hyperparameters, train the model on several combinations of training and validation \n",
    "#sets (folds).\n",
    "#       - Evaluate the model's performance on each validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    c. **Evaluate Performance:**\n",
    "#       - Use a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to assess the model's performance for each \n",
    "#hyperparameter combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    d. **Select Optimal Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "#       - Identify the hyperparameter combination that yields the best performance across all cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    e. **Train Final Model:**\n",
    "#       - Train the final model using the optimal hyperparameters on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Implementation in scikit-learn:**\n",
    "#    - scikit-learn provides the `GridSearchCV` class to perform grid search with cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      ```python\n",
    "#      from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n",

    "#      model = YourModel()\n",
    "#      grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\n",
    "\n",
    "#      # Fit the GridSearchCV object to the data\n",
    "#      grid_search.fit(X, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "#      # Access the best hyperparameters\n",
    "#      best_params = grid_search.best_params_\n",
    "#      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Benefits of Grid Search CV:**\n",
    "#    - Systematically explores hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "#    - Reduces the risk of selecting suboptimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "#    - Provides a more robust estimate of model performance through cross-validation.\n",

    "#    - **Formula:** `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`\n",
    "#    - **Interpretation:** High recall indicates that the model captures a large portion of the actual positive \n",

    "#    - **Balancing Act:** Precision and recall are often in tension with each other; improving one may degrade the other.\n",

    "#      ```python\n",
    "#      # High Precision, Low Recall\n",
