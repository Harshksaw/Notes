# PW Skills DataScience Course Assignment Solutions 

This repository contains the assignment solutions solved during the course duration of Data Science Masters by Pw Skills

## Introduction

This DataScience course is  an advanced course starting covering all the crucial topics of datascience like Web Scrapping, Statistics, Visualizations, EDA, Machine Learning Algorithmns, Implementation of ML algorithmns in end to end Projects using pipelines, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP.

The course is also currently going on so it will be updated regularly whenever an assignment is given .


## Structure

The Assignments are names in the format :  ``Project_WeekNo_AssignmentNumberofthatWeek_ConceptUsedintheAssignment.ipynb``.

In the solutions while solving the assignments I have also gone a bit deep by exploring the web and learning new things which are also a part in some assignments. Also, I have made notes for all the topics and a detailed repository will be made soon in a much more structured format including some pratice codes, notes, assignment questions and solutions.

All the assignments are completed using Jupyter notebook in a way I understood the concepts feel free to go through them as they cover almost the most vital topics involved during the interviews.


## Performance

There is also a scoreboard in the course to encourage people to complete assignments correctly and on timely basis and currently I am proudly at the top of the leaderboard ❗❗
