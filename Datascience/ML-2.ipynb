    "Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "Q1: Description of Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm\n",
    "The Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. The goal is to create a tree-like model that predicts the target variable by making decisions at each internal node and assigning a label at each leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Step-by-Step Explanation of Mathematical Intuition\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy Calculation: Measure of impurity in the dataset.\n",
    "Information Gain Calculation: Determine the effectiveness of a feature in reducing entropy.\n",
    "Select the Best Feature: Choose the feature with the highest information gain as the decision node.\n",
    "Recursive Partitioning: Split the dataset into subsets based on the chosen feature.\n",
    "Repeat: Continue the process for each subset until a stopping condition is met.\n",
    "Q3: Using Decision Tree for Binary Classification\n",
    "In binary classification, the decision tree predicts one of two classes at each leaf node, making it suitable for problems like spam detection (spam or not spam), fraud detection (fraudulent or not), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Geometric Intuition and Predictions\n",
    "Decision trees can be visualized as a series of splits in feature space. Each split creates boundaries that separate data points belonging to different classes. Predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf, where the final decision is based on the majority class in that leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Confusion Matrix and Model Evaluation\n",
    "The confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model. It includes metrics such as True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Example of Confusion Matrix and Metrics Calculation\n",
    "Predicted Positive\tPredicted Negative\n",
    "Actual Positive\tTrue Positive (TP)\tFalse Negative (FN)\n",
    "Actual Negative\tFalse Positive (FP)\tTrue Negative (TN)\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Importance of Choosing Evaluation Metric\n",
    "Choosing the right evaluation metric is crucial as it depends on the specific goals and requirements of the problem. For example, in medical diagnosis, where false negatives can be critical, recall might be more important than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Example Where Precision is Most Important\n",
    "In an email filtering system, where marking a non-spam email as spam is more detrimental than missing some spam emails, precision is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Example Where Recall is Most Important\n",
    "In a cancer detection system, missing a positive case (patient having cancer) is more critical than incorrectly diagnosing a healthy patient. Thus, recall is more important.\n",
