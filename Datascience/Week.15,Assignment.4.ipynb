    "#Answer.1 : # Lasso Regression Overview and Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Objective:\n",
    "#    - Lasso Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function, \n",
    "#aiming to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values along with the absolute values \n",
    "#of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Cost Function for Lasso:\n",
    "#    - Cost = RSS (Residual Sum of Squares) + alpha * Σ|β_i|\n",
    "#    - RSS measures the squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "#    - The penalty term involves the absolute values of the coefficients, controlled by the regularization\n",
    "#parameter (alpha or lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Coefficient Shrinkage:\n",
    "#    - Lasso Regression tends to shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, leading to sparse models.\n",
    "#    - This sparsity-inducing property makes Lasso useful for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Feature Selection:\n",
    "#    - Lasso can be employed for automatic feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "#    - Features with non-zero coefficients are considered relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Comparison with Ridge Regression:\n",
    "#    - Lasso differs from Ridge Regression, which uses the sum of squared coefficients as the penalty term.\n",
    "#    - Ridge rarely forces coefficients to be exactly zero, preserving all features but with reduced weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Differences from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):\n",
    "#    - Unlike Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Lasso introduces a penalty term to prevent overfitting,\n",
    "#especially in the presence of a large number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Limitations:\n",
    "#    - Lasso may struggle when dealing with highly correlated predictors (multicollinearity) as it tends to arbitrarily\n",

    "#Answer.2 : # Advantage of Lasso Regression in Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Automatic Feature Selection:\n",
    "#    - Lasso Regression automatically selects a subset of features by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "#    - Features with non-zero coefficients are considered relevant predictors, leading to automatic feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Sparsity-Inducing Property:\n",
    "#    - The L1 penalty term in the cost function of Lasso encourages sparsity by penalizing the absolute values of the \n",
    "#coefficients.\n",
    "#    - This sparsity-inducing property makes Lasso particularly effective in scenarios where feature sparsity is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Simplicity and Interpretability:\n",
    "#    - The resulting sparse model simplifies the set of predictors, making it easier to interpret and potentially \n",
    "#reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Identifying Key Predictors:\n",
    "#    - Lasso helps identify and prioritize key predictors by assigning non-zero coefficients to the most relevant features.\n",
    "#    - This is valuable in situations where the goal is to focus on a subset of important variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Handling High-Dimensional Data:\n",
    "#    - Lasso is well-suited for high-dimensional datasets where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of \n",
    "#observations.\n",
    "#    - It efficiently handles datasets with a large number of potential predictors, providing a more parsimonious model.\n",
