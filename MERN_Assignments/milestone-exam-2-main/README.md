# Milestone Exam 2

This repository contains three different web applications: **blog-website**, **movie-search**, and **todo-app**. Each application is built using different technologies and serves different purposes. Below you will find a brief overview and instructions on how to use and deploy each application.

## Blog Website

The **blog-website** is a simple blog application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add blog posts and read existing ones. Blog posts are stored in the browser's local storage, meaning they will be saved locally on your device.

### Usage

1. Open the `blog-website/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the "Add Blog" functionality to create a new blog post.
3. Existing blog posts will be displayed below the "Add Blog" section. Click on a blog post to read its content.

## Movie Search

The **movie-search** application is designed to search for movies using the OMDB API (omdbapi.com). It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application fetches movie data from the API and displays a list of search results.

### Usage

1. Open the `movie-search/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the name of a movie in the search box and click the "Search" button.
3. The application will fetch movie data from OMDB API and display a list of search results with relevant information.

## Todo App

The **todo-app** is a simple Todo application built using React. It allows users to add tasks, update their status, and remove tasks. The task data is stored in the browser's local storage.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `todo-app` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
4. Open your web browser and visit the development server URL (usually http://localhost:5173).
5. Use the Todo App to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove completed tasks.
