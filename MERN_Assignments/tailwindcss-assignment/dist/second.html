                writing most of
                the book,
                I
                asked him
                again about
                his
                tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart people I work
                with,
                and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they
                don't."

                iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs
                was
                surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very
                loving wife, sister, and four children</p>
