                entrepreneurial
                creation myth </span> writ large:
            Steve Jobs
            cofounded
            Apple in his
            parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the
            time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped
            to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail
            stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators, along with
            Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their
            personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.
